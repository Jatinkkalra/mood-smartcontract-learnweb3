# Objective

This is a simple smart contract which calls `getMood()` and `setMood()` functions on localhost.

## Contracts

### mood.sol

# Setup

Below is a quick summary of the steps I used to write this repo. Mainly for personal reference only.

## Console Setup Commands

```js
`npm install -g lite-server`; //
```

## Create Folders and Files

- "README.md" file
- "index.html" file
- "mood.sol" file

> _**Note**: Rest folders/files will be automatically created by the dependencies._

## Command Prompts:

- `lite-server` // Runs the code on localhost:3000

# Notes

- Used Remix IDE to deploy the mood.sol contract and get the ABI and contract address easily. (Recommend by the tutorial)
